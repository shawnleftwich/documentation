# REST API

Very little information is required to actually create objects in
TriumphPay Audit, often just a name and external_id. However, in order for
TriumphPay Audit to work well, we need as much information as you can give us.

All dates + times should be in
[iso8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. All `external_id`s should be strings.

Request:

All parameters are required.

Response:

    "amount_mismatch_failure": {
      "broker_amount": "50.0"    // Optional additional data
    }
  }
}
```

#### Possible `state`

| Value |
| ----- |
| `pending` |
| `success` |
| `fail` |
| `non_participating_carrier` |
| `non_participating_broker` |

In the case of a `pending` response,
you should retry the same request after 1 minute.
In the event that the verification data is still unavailable after 5 attempts,
you can consider this a failure in our service.
We monitor for these issues, and they should rarely occur.

#### Possible `disclosure_details`

This field provides more detailed information in the `fail` case.
It is `null` for all other states.

Verifications can fail for multiple reasons,
so the value object will have _at least_ one key.
Keys may be added in the future for new failure types.

Each failure _may_ provide additional data within the JSON value.
Each additional data field is _optional_.
Keys may be added in the future for new failure data.

| Key | Additional data fields |
| --- | ----- |
| `amount_mismatch_failure` | `broker_amount` â€” NUMERIC STRING, ex. `"99.99"` |
| `undelivered_failure` | none |
| `load_issue_failure` | none |
| `load_not_found_failure` | none |
| `carrier_mismatch_failure` | none |
| `possible_fees_failure` | none |
| `remit_to_failure` | none |
