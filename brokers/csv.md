# CSV via SFTP

All files should be sent in CSV format.

The names should match what is being uploaded, carriers.csv, loads.csv,
shipments.csv, stops.csv, customer_invoices.csv, and customers.csv.
You should add ".inprogress" to the end of
the filename while the file is being imported so we don't attempt to
import partially uploaded files.

All carriers must be uploaded every hour.

The last 24 hours of updated+inserted loads must be uploaded at most every hour
between 6 AM and 6 PM and the last 60 days of updated+inserted loads must
be uploaded at 10 PM every night. This may be subject to change
depending on how large the files are.

All dates + times should be in
[iso8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

Required fields are **bold**.

## Invoice Approval Response

This document will be sent each time invoices are approved. Since each
invoice may contain many documents, we will repeat the document columns,
incrementing the number (displayed as "X" below) for each record.

In some special situations (specific customers) `_url_` may be changed
to `_filename_` and some of the document fields may be removed. If you
are one of these special cases you'll know it.

Once the invoice has been inserted into your TMS you should send a GET
request to the url listed in `acknowledgement_url` to verify the invoice
in HubTran.
